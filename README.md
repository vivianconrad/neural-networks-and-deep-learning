# neural-networks-and-deep-learning

code from csc 590 - Neural networks and deep learning at Creighton University

_IMPORTANT_ This code is not meant to infringe on any copyright, it is code from my course to show what I have done in the past

I did not create the conceptualizations behind the code, but I did write a couple files for the class
