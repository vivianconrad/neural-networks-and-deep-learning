1\n","Write Python code that does the following. \n","\n","- Create the following function: **gear_box_finite_state_machine**, where **current_speed** is an integer value which determines speed at which we travel, We will updated the **Class GearBoxFSM** attribute value of **current_state** where we move from one state to another based on the input values where Input: **speed_value** is an integer which represents the speed at which we desire to travel and **gear_speed_tuple_list** which will already be defined as a list where each element is a tuple and each tuple will contain only two values where\n"," - The two values mean that when the index 0 value is the state which could be the current_state and index 1 value is the speed below which that particular Gear is applicable\n"," \n","  The following example represents the behavior we expect when get the respective input values\n"," - Consider a Gear Machine, that shifts to a gear i.e set that gear as current state when the desired speed is in a certain level  where the gear_speed_tuple_list = [(GearBoxFSM.GEAR_3, 60), (GearBoxFSM.GEAR_1, 20), (GearBoxFSM.NEUTRAL, 0), (GearBoxFSM.GEAR_2, 40), (GearBoxFSM.GEAR_4, 80)]\n"," - Ex: When the initial state is invalid then the first state is \"NEUTRAL\" regardless of the speed, Also when the desired speed is 0 then we set the current_state to NEUTRAL and current_speed to the same.\n","    - Ex: `Gear Box FSM Current State: NEUTRAL, Current Speed: 0, Desired Speed: 14` \n"," - When the desired speed is under 20 then we set the current_state as GEAR_1 and current_speed as the desired_speed\n","    - Ex: `Gear Box FSM Current State: GEAR_1, Current Speed: 18, Desired Speed: 18`\n"," - When the desired speed is under 40 then we set the current_state as GEAR_2 and current_speed as the desired_speed\n","    - Ex: `Gear Box FSM Current State: GEAR_2, Current Speed: 37, Desired Speed: 37`\n"," - When the desired speed is under 60 then we set the current_state as GEAR_3 and current_speed as the desired_speed\n","    - Ex: `Gear Box FSM Current State: GEAR_3, Current Speed: 59, Desired Speed: 59`\n"," - When the desired speed is under 80 then we set the current_state as GEAR_4 and current_speed as the desired_speed\n","    - Ex: `Gear Box FSM Current State: GEAR_4, Current Speed: 77, Desired Speed: 77`\n"," - When the desired speed is over 80 (which is the highest speed associated with a gear state) then we do not updated neither the current_state nor current_speed\n","    - Ex: `Gear Box FSM Current State: GEAR_4, Current Speed: 77, Desired Speed: 99`\n"," - Carefully go through the example to better understand all behaviours\n","\n","**Conditions to follow:**\n","- The output should be a string format similar to test cases mentioned below\n","- Inbuilt functions which require no import and Datatype methods can be used to solve this problem but No arbitray functions or library can be used.\n","- No other function name can be defined/declared than the ones asked to be declared in any of the questions presented in this notebook.\n","- The code you write should pass all the test cases given. \n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","TEST CASES:\n","\n","```\n","Gear Box FSM Current State: NEUTRAL, Current Speed: 0, Desired Speed: 14\n","\n","Gear Box FSM Current State: GEAR_4, Current Speed: 65, Desired Speed: 65\n","\n","Gear Box FSM Current State: GEAR_2, Current Speed: 37, Desired Speed: 37\n","\n","Gear Box FSM Current State: GEAR_3, Current Speed: 59, Desired Speed: 59\n","\n","Gear Box FSM Current State: NEUTRAL, Current Speed: 0, Desired Speed: 0\n","\n","Gear Box FSM Current State: GEAR_4, Current Speed: 77, Desired Speed: 77\n","\n","Gear Box FSM Current State: GEAR_4, Current Speed: 77, Desired Speed: 99\n","\n","Gear Box FSM Current State: GEAR_3, Current Speed: 46, Desired Speed: 46\n","\n","Gear Box FSM Current State: GEAR_1, Current Speed: 18, Desired Speed: 18\n","```\n","---\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pMh6IZ99OpYO"},"source":["### Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Moq_-AG8OpYQ","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1652189323986,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":115,"user":{"displayName":"Vmz Conrad","userId":"07925550081713979769"}},"outputId":"870b5fb3-56b3-460c-99aa-335564a38d87"},"source":["# The Current updated state object\n","class GearBoxFSM:\n","  # We will initialize the starting state as None -
